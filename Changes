Net::SSLGlue::SMTP: fixed stripping of port from host/ip for name 
verification. Added hello after successful starttls. Extented tests
to check, if we can actually talk after starttls.
Thanks to zaucker[AT]oetiker[DOT]ch for reporting problem.

rewrite parts of Net::SSLGlue::LWP so that it sends the correct request
to the peer even if https_proxy is used. In former version it ommitted
the HTTP version number in the request (thus the request was invalid).

https_proxy support for LWP, HTTPS_PROXY from Crypt::SSLeay did not work and
the https_proxy from LWP was broken with both Crypt::SSLeay and
IO::Socket::SSL (it did unencrypted https:// requests to the proxy).
Fix it so that it now does CONNECT (this is the meaning of https_proxy for
all other programs)
